# truecaller-blog

### Description

This repository contains the code for a blog website made using Vue.js.
It has two pages, a landing page where the articles are listed and a detailed view page where the complete article is displayed.  
All components were made from scratch including the paginator component which controls the page view of posts. Only external library used was moment.js for formatting time.  
  
  
All categories for a post were not listed in the post card since the ui given could not accomodate more than 2 categories. So when two or more categories were found for a post, the first two were displayed in the card. The UI was made responsive for mobile phones, desktops and laptops. It is also compatible with devices with medium resolution(tabs)
